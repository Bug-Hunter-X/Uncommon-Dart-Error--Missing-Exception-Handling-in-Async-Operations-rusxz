# Uncommon Dart Error: Missing Exception Handling in Async Operations

This repository demonstrates a subtle error that can occur in Dart asynchronous operations.  The initial code handles exceptions using a `catch` block, but it misses specific exception types (`TimeoutException` and `SocketException`). This can lead to unexpected behavior if those exceptions occur, as they might be logged as generic errors without detailed information.

The `bug.dart` file showcases this issue. The solution is provided in `bugSolution.dart`, which improves error handling by catching `TimeoutException` and `SocketException` separately.

This example highlights the importance of considering and handling specific exception types in asynchronous operations to ensure robust and reliable code.
